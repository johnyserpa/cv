After a small (70H) course and an internship @ Ideavity, I decided I needed to get more knowledge in the area and went for graduation in it. Currently in my last year and working full time @ LVEngine, I find myself as a highly motivated professional on the pursuit of good challenges and world changing projects. \nMy interest topics are: linux, javascript, nodejs, python, machine learning, blockchain, data science. \nNot that I know much about all of them, but this are topics that motivate me.",
