    "summary": "I am not an informatics prodigy. I always thought I would be working on something related to sports as I usually excelled in it and played football since young.<br/>While enlisting in university, I thought it would be better to not restrict myself only to sports, so I chose Mining Engineering. After realizing it was a bad move, I switched to Hotel Management and finished it in 2014.<br/>By that time, I was struggling to find meaning in what I was doing. Digital nomads were appearing and it led me to another point of view: What kind of life do I want, and what can I be doing in order to have it? Programming seemed like a good choice. After realizing the possibilities that programming opened me, I just started loving it.<br/>Nowadays I'm almost finishing my Informatics degree and already full-time working, I find myself as a highly motivated professional in the pursuit of good challenges and world-changing projects.<br/>My ambitions are to work with cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts and democratize economy.",
